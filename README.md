# Hasan Karadirek

## Full Stack Developer Trainee

I initiated my journey into development by creating my own website using 
Opencart, an open-source CMS. This marked my early steps into crafting digital 
experiences. My primary focus is on backend technologies, where I find joy in 
constructing robust and scalable solutions. Beyond coding, I have a deep passion 
for cinema and music, drawing inspiration from the creative arts. Engaging in 
discussions with people from diverse backgrounds is a particular interest of mine, 
contributing not only to personal growth but also enhancing my professional 
development through collaboration. On a more personal note, I hold immense love 
for animals, especially my dog, whose companionship adds an extra layer of joy to 
my life and serves as a constant source of motivation.
